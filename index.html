                Stardew Valley is a game about farming, community and living off the land. You become the owner of your grandfather's farm after you grow fed up with life in the city. You meet a colorful cast of creatures and characters, help the town and rebuild your grandfather's farm to its former glory.

            <p class="community-text">
                The community is one of the most well-known parts of Stardew Valley. They welcome everyone and provide tips and help to anyone who has a question about the game. One of the favoured hobbies in the community is to create your own farms and show them off. Some people makes farms for their personal tastes, some are themed farms for the different seasons and some are for max crop productivity. The customisation options are endless and this is constantly being taken advantage of by the community.
